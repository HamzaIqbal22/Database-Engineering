# Data Engineering

## Course Overview 
Lab work for Data Engineering involving the creation of an Esports Database accomplished using SQL and VScode. 

Data engineering stands at the heart of crafting scalable software applications with efficiency. Robust data management strategies become imperative when dealing with substantial volumes of Big Data for processing. Delved into pertinent subjects, including entity-relation diagrams, relational databases, languages for data definition and manipulation, formats for structured data representations, the creation of innovative vocabularies, semi-structured data, and cutting-edge concepts within NoSQL databases.

## Project (Leauge of Legends Esports Database) Overview
This project aims to build an application that maintains a database of esports matches for League of Legends, one of the most popular games worldwide. League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five playable champions face off to eliminate the otherâ€™s base. The application will store various information surrounding and related to the match, including player statistics, champion data, team details, match summaries, and more.

The primary objectives of the project include:

- Storing detailed information about basketball players, teams, statistics, and profile.
- Retrieving various forms of information from the database such as player statistics.
- Answering vital questions related to player statistics, performance, team data, and details.
